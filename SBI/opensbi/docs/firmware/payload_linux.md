Linux as a direct payload to OpenSBI
====================================

OpenSBI has the capability to load Linux kernel image directly in supervisor
mode. The flattened image generated by the Linux kernel build process can be
provided as payload to OpenSBI.

Detailed examples and platform guides can be found in both [QEMU](
../platform/qemu_virt.md) and [HiFive Unleashed](../platform/sifive_fu540.md)
platform guide respectively.
